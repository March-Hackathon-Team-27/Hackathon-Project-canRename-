## Features
Each page features consistent design to facilitate an intuitive and comfortable user experience.  There is a central home page with links directly to each game for quick and easy use.

The website has a number of games to choose from, meaning users do not have to switch through various sites to facilitate their celebration.
1. Trivia - Designed as a conversation feeder, an interesting and topical interactive experience to encourage dialog amongst participants.
2. Quiz - An interactive general Irish knowledge quiz.  Households can each open the page to complete the quiz and track their score, or all households can work together to try to beat the game and get top marks.  Set length to quiz to provide structure.
3. Prompts - An open ended interactive game where a card is drawn and each household ventures an answer.  The other households vote for their favourite, keeping score off-site.  There is no set length to this game.

### Existing Features
* Nav bar in universal standard position to help users feel intuitively at home with the site.  Uniform across all pages.
* Bright, on-theme design to help users feel part of a wider celebration.
* Uniform footer on every page.

2. Sign in to GitHub.
3. A list of repositories should display on the left of the page. Choose the appropriate repository: lilblupig/curls-ms1
4. From the repository menu, choose Settings.
