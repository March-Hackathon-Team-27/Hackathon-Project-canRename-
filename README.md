# What's The Craic?

A compact collection of simple Irish themed games or trivia which can be enjoyed across a video call by multiple households - enabling celebration of St Patrick's Day together, but apart!

1. Selection of trivia flip cards to try out knowledge of Irish language.
2. A quiz for households to compare Irish general knowledge.
3. Game of prompts, Irish themed categories where households vote for the best answer!

## UX

This website is for friends and family who would normally celebrate together but are unable to do so because of the lockdown.  The website provides activities to undertake together, bith competetive and just for interest and fun.  The users are likely to include families, so the activities are suitable for all ages.  The users are likely to need to share the screen on a video call, so the design is clear and simple.

The owners of this website want to bring together people for a multitude of reasons, St Par=trick's Day is an enormous social celebration in Ireland and this website facilitates social activity to emulate that as far as possible.  It will also help those who might feel isolated in their celebration (or lack thereof) to feel included and part of the community they would normally engage with at this time of year.

## Features
Each page features consistent design to facilitate an intuitive and comfortable user experience.  There is a central home page with links directly to each game for quick and easy use.

The website has a number of games to choose from, meaning users do not have to switch through various sites to facilitate their celebration.
1. Trivia - Designed as a conversation feeder, an interesting and topical interactive experience to encourage dialog amongst participants.
2. Quiz - An interactive general Irish knowledge quiz.  Households can each open the page to complete the quiz and track their score, or all households can work together to try to beat the game and get top marks.  Set length to quiz to provide structure.
3. Prompts - An open ended interactive game where a card is drawn and each household ventures an answer.  The other households vote for their favourite, keeping score off-site.  There is no set length to this game.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
